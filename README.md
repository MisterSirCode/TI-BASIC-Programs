# TI BASIC Programs
Some (maybe?) useful tools I made in college for my own use.

These are just some applications I tossed together during my Electrical Engineering degree that I may have wanted to have on hand.

Ex: ELCUNITS program<br>

# Editing?
Use TI Connect CE to export the script to a calculator. 

If you need to convert the plaintext script, copy and paste it's contents into the app and export it as a new script.

# What do these do?

- ELCUNITS
    - A simple converter for various units in electrical engineering. It's not comprehensive, but it has most or all of what I needed or used.
